        <h1 class="section-title">Key Facts</h1>
        <p>Skin cancer is a widespread concern, with over 5 million cases diagnosed globally each year. It encompasses several types, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds is the primary risk factor. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>Skin cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of skin cells, often triggered by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the
            sun or artificial sources like tanning beds. It is the most common type of cancer worldwide, affecting people of all skin types,
            though those with fair skin are at higher risk. Skin cancer primarily develops on sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face,
            ears, neck, scalp, shoulders, and back. However, it can also occur in less exposed areas like the palms, soles, and under the nails.
            The disease can manifest in several forms, with basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma being the most prevalent.
            While BCC and SCC are more common and generally less aggressive, melanoma is rarer but more likely to spread and can be deadly if not
            detected early. Recognizing changes in the skin, such as new growths, sores that don’t heal, or changes in existing moles, is critical
            for early detection. Regular skin checks and protective
            measures against UV exposure are essential components of prevention.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Skin cancer can present various symptoms that may signal an issue within the skin, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes in moles or existing skin lesions</li>
            <li>Development of new growths on the skin</li>
            <li>Sores that do not heal</li>
            <li>Changes in skin texture or color</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Early symptoms of skin cancer may be mild or dismissed as common skin conditions, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis.</p>
    </div>
 <div class="section">
 <h2 class="section-title">Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Regular use of sunscreen with high SPF, wearing protective clothing, and seeking shade.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoidance of Tanning Beds:</strong> Limiting exposure to artificial UV radiation sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Skin Checks:</strong> Performing self-examinations and scheduling regular skin checks with a dermatologist.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Early treatment can prevent skin cancer from worsening and spreading to other areas of the body. Prevention of skin cancer involves both primary and secondary measures. Primary prevention focuses on reducing risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors to prevent the initial development of the disease. This includes practices such as sun protection, avoiding excessive UV exposure, and regular skin checks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Diagnosis</h2>

        <p>Diagnosis typically involves a visual examination followed by a biopsy of suspicious lesions.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Visual inspection:</strong> Examination of the skin for any abnormal growths, changes in moles, or lesions.</li>
    <li><strong>Dermoscopy: </strong> Use of a handheld device with magnification and polarized light to examine skin lesions in more detail.</li>
    <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> Removal of a sample of suspicious skin tissue for examination under a microscope to determine if cancer cells are present.</li>
    <li><strong>Skin imaging:</strong> Techniques such as ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans may be used to assess the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel lymph node biopsy:</strong> Removal and examination of nearby lymph nodes to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the skin.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title" color="Blue">Treatment and Care</h2>
        <p>Treatments for lung cancer are based on the type of cancer, how much it has spread, and the person’s medical history. Early detection of lung cancer can lead to better treatments and outcomes. Treatments include:</p>
       <ul>
    <li><strong>Surgical excision: </strong>Removal of the cancerous lesion and a margin of surrounding healthy tissue to ensure complete removal.</li>
    <li><strong>Mohs surgery: </strong>A specialized technique to remove skin cancer layer by layer, examining each layer under a microscope until no cancer cells remain.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> Using high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells, often used for cancers in areas difficult to treat with surgery.</li>
    <li><strong>Chemotherapy: </strong>Medications that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing, sometimes used for advanced or metastatic skin cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Immunotherapy: </strong>Drugs that help the immune system fight cancer, particularly effective for advanced melanoma.</li>
    <li><strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> Medications that target specific genetic mutations in cancer cells, used for certain types of advanced skin cancer.</li>
</ul>
